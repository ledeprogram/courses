      "One of the earliest digitization tasks that we performed with machines was the task of converting text into digital signals. One of the earliest and most successful schemes for representing text for digital transmission was Morse Code, which represents each letter as a series of short or long on/off signals:\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The process of communicating with Morse Code looked something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Start with original (written) text\n",
      "2. \"Encode\" text as Morse Code signals\n",
      "3. Send signals (e.g., over a telegraph wire)\n",
      "4. \"Decode\" text at destination\n",
      "\n",
      "The result is a text that has all of the same characters as the original text. Morse Code is unlike contemporary digital network transmission in that [it is *not* strictly digital](http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/39922), and the encoding/decoding steps were usually done by human beings instead of machines. But the idea is the same: text starts out in one place, with one representation, is then converted to a code and transmitted, and is then decoded at the destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "> There were a number of other schemes for transmitting text digitally before the advent of contemporary computers and networking technology, most notably [Baudot Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code), which encoded each letter in a multiplexed signal of five bits (on/off signals).\n",
      "\n",
      "###ASCII and ye shall receive\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern digital computers (say, from 1960 onward) usually store and transmit data in chunks of eight bits. Each of these chunks is called a \"byte.\" A byte, containing eight bits, can store one of 256 distinct values (2 to the 8th power = 256). The earliest schemes for encoding text digitally for storage and transmission took advantage of this fact, and \"encoded\" text by assigning each letter and symbol to a unique number somewhere in the range of 0 to 255.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there's no obvious correspondence between characters and numbers. (Maybe \"A\" should be represented by the number 1, sure, but what number do you use to represent \"!\" or \")\"?) So individual organizations invented their own \"standards\" for how numbers should be assigned to characters. In the 50s and 60s there was a veritable Cambrian explosion of such standards, with names like Fieldata and EBCDIC. Each of these standards used different numbers for different characters. (Fieldata represented the letter \"A\" with the number 6; EBCDIC represented \"A\" with 193.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to this Babel of encodings, the American Standards Association created a committee in the early 1960s to create one character encoding standard to rule them all. The result of the committee was a standard called \"ASCII\" (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). Here's a table of the characters in ASCII and the numbers they correspond with:\n",

      "###Getting on the same (code) page\n",
      "\n",
      "ASCII, as a standard, has a lot of virtues, which led to its wide adoption in the late 60s and early 70s. In 1968 U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson declared that all federal computer systems must be ASCII-compliant. ASCII remains, to this day, the \"default\" character encoding for a wide variety of software and hardware systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "But ASCII has a lot of problems, too. The most glaring problem is that the selection of characters is very limited: just the letters of the English alphabet, plus some basic typographical symbols. The standard was popular enough in the U.S. that computer manufacturers in other countries wanted to adopt the standard as well. But in order to represent text written in the language of those countries, those manufacturers needed to either use the standard creatively, by replacing characters in the existing set, or *extend* the standard by adding new characters to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conveniently, ASCII actually only uses 128 characters---enough to fill seven bits, not eight (the seventh bit had previously been reserved for a [parity check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit)). So each manufacturer (and sometimes each *company*) came up with ideas for how to use the remaining 128 characters by making use of the spare bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "These schemes varied *wildly* in which symbols they chose to represent and which numbers they assigned to these characters. Compare, for example, the non-ASCII portions of two popular encodings, [Windows 1252](http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/cp1252-8thbit.png) (popularly but inaccurately known as Latin-1) and [MacRoman](http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/macroman-8thbit.png) (used by Macintosh computers up until OSX). A lot of the same characters, but all represented by different numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A general term for an extended ASCII encoding is \"code page\"; you can [see a list of known code pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page) on Wikipedia. As you can see, it's kind of a mess: dozens of encodings, sometimes multiple encodings for the same language and region. And the variety of code pages doesn't even encompass text encoding systems for the writing systems of languages like Japanese and Chinese, which can't easily and intuitively be enumerated in an 8-bit number space.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Unicode to the rescue\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to this explosion of code pages and conflicting text encoding standards, in 1987 a working group from Apple and Xerox started working on something called \"[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)\": a single character encoding that would encompass all characters in all written languages across the world. As this idea gained steam, the Unicode Consortium (with stakeholders from other organizations) was created in 1991, and since then the Consortium has been publishing versions of the Unicode Standard, which defines how Unicode works. The current (as of this writing) version of the Unicode standard is [Unicode 8.0.0](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "Unicode is, at its core, just a big list of characters. [You can see the list of supported characters here](http://www.unicode.org/charts/). Each character is given a number; this number is known as its \"code point.\" (There are units other than written characters that have \"code points\" as well, like combining characters, white space, control characters, etc. But the basic rule is one code point per character.) Unicode code points are often written with `U+` as a prefix, followed by a hexidecimal number, so you'll often see things like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `U+2192: RIGHTWARDS ARROW` (\u2192)\n",
      "* `U+0041: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A` (A)\n",
      "* `U+308F: HIRAGANA LETTER WA` (\u308f)\n",
      "\n",
      "In total, the Unicode standard reserves code points for over one million different symbols, and currently defines in its catalog many tens of thousands of symbols.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its creation, Unicode has been widely adopted across the world, gradually supplanting ASCII and vendor-/nation-specific code pages as the standard for transmitting and storing text.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Encoding Unicode\n",
      "\n",
      "So Unicode is pretty great! One standard that associates a number with, like, every known character in every human writing system. Problem solved, right? Well, not quite. The problem with Unicode code points is that there are SO MANY OF THEM, which means that it's difficult to digitally represent Unicode in a space-efficient way.\n",
      "\n",
      "To explain, let's go back to ASCII. There's a reason that ASCII was limited to 128 characters: that's just enough to have all common English characters while still comfortably fitting into the basic unit of computer storage: the byte. One character to one byte is very space-efficient and also very convenient from a programming standpoint. Underneath the hood, most low(ish)-level programming languages operate on bytes directly, which means that storing text data as bytes makes many operations (like iterating over each character in a string, or counting the number of characters in a string, or allocating new memory for a string) very easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Unicode defines *too many characters* for each character to take up one byte exactly. In fact, you'd need *four* bytes of memory to represent any given Unicode character. (4 bytes = 32 bits = 4294967296 possible values, more than enough for every Unicode code point.)\n",
      "\n",
      "This, on its face, is enough to make most programmers and system adminstrators balk. \"So if I want to convert all of my data to Unicode, it'll use *quadruple* the amount of space?\" they'd say. \"And transmitting it over the Internet will take four times the bandwidth? I'll just stick with my code page mess, thank you very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "###UTF-8\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to ameliorate the bandwidth and storage problems of sending/storing Unicode characters as four bytes of data, a standard called \"[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)\" was invented. UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding that uses some clever tricks to store Unicode text cleanly and efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "This standard takes advantage of the fact that, because of some finagling in the standard, the original ASCII characters included in Unicode have the same integer value in ASCII as their Unicode code points. (E.g., 'A' in ASCII is value 0x41 but also Unicode code point U+0041.) In UTF-8, all characters whose code points numbers can be represented in fewer than 8 bits (i.e., all ASCII characters) simply end up in the string as their original numerical values---which means that ASCII text and UTF-8 text are technically identical. Characters with code points whose numbers are larger are encoded with a progressively larger number of bytes, with 4 bytes being the maximum number of bytes used to represent any character.\n",
      "\n",
      "We won't go over the specifics of the way that UTF-8 represents Unicode text, or attempt to reproduce an algorithm to decode it. [But you can read more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Examples).\n",
      "\n",
      "##What does this have to do with Python\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize: text can be represented in many different ways. Some text encodings, like ASCII and extended ASCII code pages, represent text so that each character can fit into one byte. The Unicode standard can represent (potentially) ANY character, but there are certain encoding schemes needed to represent that data efficiently (i.e., with fewer than four bytes per character). UTF-8 is one such standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what does any of this have to do with Python?\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall the instructions we used for encoding, transmitting, and decoding Morse Code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Start with original (written) text\n",
      "2. \"Encode\" text as Morse Code signals\n",
      "3. Send signals (e.g., over a telegraph wire)\n",
      "4. \"Decode\" text at destination\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, we often get source text from various sources. That text comes pre-encoded as bytes. It's our job to find out what the encoding was, and then use the appropriate *decoding* procedure to turn that encoded text back into characters that we can work with.\n",
      "\n",
      "To that end, Python has *two* data types that are used to represent strings of characters. The first is the *string*, which is the data type that you get by default when you, e.g., use a string literal. So, for example:"

      "* This document only describes how Unicode works in Python 2.7. The way that Python handles Unicode (and strings in general) changed significantly in Python 3. [Here's a good overview](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/1/5/unicode-in-2-and-3/) of the changes. (Basically: there is no more `str` type; strings are all Unicode by default; a new `bytes` type fills in the gap left by `str`)\n",
