Use of the Defense Production Act of 1950 for Critical Infrastructure 1 Protection
Executive Summary
· Critical infrastructure protection requires an integration of multiple goals, objectives, and policies. Currently, this nation lacks agreement on a comprehensive philosophic and legislative framework that integrates com peting policies for infrastructure protection purposes. · The Defense Production Act of 1950 is a powerful legislative tool for managing critical infrastructure service failures. At the core of critical infrastructure protection philosophy is a concern for national security, national defense, and the public health and welfare. Critical infrastructure preparedness, response, and restoration could all benefit

from using the DPA in a judicious and targeted manner. · Congress has not thoroughly debated using the DPA for critical infrastructure disruptions. During the Year 2000 preparations, the Ad min istra tion was equally di vided on whether, and to what extent, the President could use the DPA in the event of a significant critical infrastructure disruption. · Several complex legal and policy issues permeate the debate. These include the definition of "national defense" in an information age context as well as the execution of Congress's delegation by the Administration, as reflected in Executive Order 12919.

As a result, managing infrastructure disruptions demands alternative preparedness, response, and restoration strategies.

Absent this framework, the nation will continue to lack a unified approach to managing national cyber emergencies.

of the National Security Resources Board entered the Dirksen Building with his counsel for the first of a three-day hearing on legislation entitled the Defense Production Act of 1950. The Administration proposal combined certain of the emergency economic powers exercised during and after World War II into a permanent legislative framework.7 These powers were necessary to place goods and services where they were most needed. President Truman could exercise these powers during peacetime and absent any declaration of national emergency. The core of the proposal would allow the President to prioritize and expedite delivery (or allocation) of critical materials. If company A contracts to deliver widgets to company B, but the government needs the widgetswhether for itself or for Company Cthe President could so order the prioritization of contract delivery according to terms "necessary to promote the national defense." For three days, members of the Banking and Currency Committee debated a series of questions exploring the relationship between economic sta bility, na tional de fense, and the projection of power and national authority. The Senators' questions revealed deep concerns over both the Cold War and an ongoing need to re struc ture na tional eco nomic pro grams, courses of action, and priorities:
· Does economic and industrial stability translate into the projection of power and, if so, how does this promote the national defense? · How much extraordinary authority should the Congress delegate to the President during peacetime? That is, do we need a legislative framework if there is no war, significant

military conflict, or Presidential declaration of emergency? Indeed, · Could Congress trust the President to administer the legislative framework? If not, how could Con gress pos si bly per form these responsibilities? The exceptional debate that followed raised complex questions for a nation that had learned more than a little about national defense during the preceding decade. The irony of delegating extraordinary economic powers to preserve a free economy was not lost on the Senate that week, but the complexity of mobilizing after Pearl Harbor (not to mention the perception of the country as weak and vulnerable, which might have precipitated the attack) was fresh on the mind of each and every Senator. The debate conveyed a profound sense of national import where reasonable public servants could differ. Members of the Banking and Currency Committee also understood that the nation was entering the Cold War and by week's end sided with the Truman Administration. There was no solid agreement on how the new world order impacted national defense, but the Senate clearly understood the importance of bridging complex and emerging policy concerns into a single, integrated legislative framework. Clinton Administration Debates Use of DPA for Y2K crisis A half-century later, as the nation prepared for the Year 2000 ("Year 2000" or "Y2K") glitch in the summer of 1999, senior officials in the Clinton Administration and their counsel met to discuss whether the DPA could and should be used in the event a Y2K infrastructure outage resulted in a national crisis. Senior leaders grappled with two questions:

1. What is the national philosophy for preparing for, responding to, and recovering from significant critical infrastructure outages? 2. Could the DPA be used to expedite delivery or allocation of goods and services to fulfill these goals? Multiple areas of disagreement emerged in the six-month Y2K discussions. The most significant concerned the relevance of the Federal Response Plan framework in managing critical infrastructure disruptions of national significance and negotiating the roles and responsibilities of multiple agencies in managing a national cyber-crisis.8 Pursuant to Executive order 12919, signed in 1994, FEMA is charged with coordinating plans and programs among the civilian agencies for national defense industrial resource preparedness issues.9 But did it make sense in the Information Age to saddle FEMA with responsibility for both cy ber and traditional natural disaster management? In addition, what was the best process for negotiating and coming to agreement on priorities? If a significant cyber-disruption occurred, how would the consequences be managed and prioritized? Should the federal government seek to restore services as quickly as possible

via the DPA or manage the consequences of the disruption through traditional means, such as via the Federal Response Plan?10 How would law enforcement, intelligence, and defense issues be parsed by FEMA within the framework developed by the Clinton Administration? The lack of any pertinent Congressional testimony, debate, or other legal guidance on use of the DPA unquestionably impaired the Administration's ability to settle these disagreements. 11 Senior administration officials debated the issue late into December, 1999. As the Millennium Rollover came and went, no final agreement was ever reached.12 Answers to these questions have significant impact on whether to use the DPA, and if so how broadly to interpret its terms. In sum: As we enter the 21st century, how does "national defense" re late to the de liv ery of criti cal infrastructure services? Specifically:
· What is the relationship between national defense and the orderly functioning of the nation's critical infrastructure services? · If the DPA could be used, what prioritization plans and policies were in place to determine which entities benefited from the expedited

The Federal Response Plan is based on the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended, 42 USC § 5121 et seq. ("Stafford Act"). National Defense Industrial Resources Preparedness, Executive Order 12919 (June 7, 1994) (One exception relates to energy issues, which are coordinated by the Department of Energy). As an example, a Federal Response Plan approach ruled out use of other highly responsive and successful programs that service critical infrastructure emergencies. See, e.g., Defense Priorities & Allocations System ("DPAS"). [A highly flexible process for administering critical infrastructure crisis, DPAS is administered by the Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security, Bureau of Export Administration (Dept. of Commerce) pursuant to the DPA. See 15 CRF Part 700.] Congress has not addressed the basic terms and definitions in the DPA for application in an economy that relies on critical infrastructure services. How, for example, do the terms incorporate the nation's dependence on information services? "Energy" is clearly included in the DPA, but how does the energy infrastructure reliance on communications alter the statutory definition? See DPA definitions at 50 US App. § 2152. This was not the first time senior officials within the Clinton Administration carefully examined the DPA and its implementing programs. See, e.g., Report of the Interagency Subworking Group of the National Security Council's Ad Hoc Interagency Working Group on National Security Emergency Resources Preparedness (December, 1996), Administration working group recommends overhaul of Executive Order 12919, and other authorities, which implement the DPA.

What is the Nation's Philosophy for Managing Critical Infrastructure Risk?

The nation, including the state and local governments and industry, deserve high praise for resolving a potential crisis. But efforts to address lessons learned and to benefit from the experience have been lost. As soon as the Millennium Rollover passed, the federal government dismantled valuable facilities, partnerships, and institutions, all of which offered significant value; similarly, in many state and local governments, valuable facilities and institutions were set aside.

At the core of critical infrastructure protection is a concern for national security. Critical infrastructure protection is a shared responsibility.

Since its inception in the aftermath of the tragic Oklahoma City bombing, critical infrastructure protection has always focused on widespread and catastrophic damage. In most cases where infrastructures fail, for whatever reason, owners and operators in industry and government are typically able to manage response and recovery efforts through normal business and risk management processes. For purposes of the Defense Production Act analysis, this is a significant distinction. Congress never intended the DPA to be used for general business purposes or for emergencies that could be managed under normal business continuity and disaster preparedness programs. Conversely, however, where such damages could result, use of the

In contrast, many of the programs established for traditional emergency response purposes focus on first responder capabilities and needs.

Pursuant to the Stafford Act, and the Federal Response Plan that implements operational responsibility under that law, our nation relies heavily on traditional emergency preparedness programs and policies to manage a range of complex disasters.

For purposes of Defense Department functions and operational needs, this should be fairly obvious. The Defense Department relies heavily on infrastructure services, whether conducting operations at home or abroad. A failure to develop reliable service delivery patterns would have catastrophic effects on our ability to project power overseas. Traditional Emergency Preparedness The repeal of the Civil Defense Act of 1950 by the Stafford Act almost 10 years ago set the There are several important distinctions. First, the underlying philosophy for most emergency preparedness policies and programs is to mitigate the damages of a crisis. This framework, which is both successful and well integrated through years of trial and error, does not traditionally include industry critical infrastructure disruptions, which is a private sector concern. This is so even where the disruptions adversely impact the delivery of critical federal government services. As discussed elsewhere, the Y2K Operations Supplement to the Federal

Response Plan explicitly excluded core critical infrastructure activities.17 Second, the funding mechanisms for providing federal assistance and aid are set in law. Stafford Act funding for emergency response activity flows from the federal government under conditions set by the Stafford Act and its Administrative guidance. For example, during Y2K, a Presidential "emergency" was needed ­ as opposed to a "major disaster" declaration."18 Third, the amount of aid needed to support critical infrastructure disruptions is unknown. Federal government administrators understand the cost of traditional emergency preparedness activities. The cost of critical infrastructure disrup tions is not well un der stood or eas ily quantifiable. Cyber-related disasters could re sult in enormous damages absent appropriate mitigation programs and processes. Finally, traditional emergency preparedness goals are accomplished in today's legislative framework by aligning federal disaster relief programs with similar operational structures across the federal government and at the state and local levels. Long-term partnerships and relationships ­ which are crucial for disaster management capability, are built on skill sets, goals, and arrangements vastly different than those in the critical infrastructure community.

Law Enforcement / Intelligence Similar to traditional emergency preparedness, a pure law enforcement or intelligence philosophy will not, by itself, resolve complex critical infrastructure challenges. Historically, the nation moved in that direction shortly after the Okla homa City bomb ing with re lease of PDD-39. Two years later, the federal government imported PDD-39 into the Federal Response Plan mecha nism as the Terror ism Annex.19 This policy distinguished between consequence management and crisis management, creating room in the aftermath of an incident for law enforcement to investigate and ful fill its Con gres sional re spon si bili ties. 20 Where the attack is ongoing, law enforcement and intelligence gathering are crucial to locating and stopping the damage. Room for consequence management authorities to conduct their work is negotiated pursuant to the Federal Response Plan mechanism How would a law enforcement philosophy and framework support and fulfill critical infrastructure objectives? In many cases, policy choices may exist in opposition. As in the Year 2000 preparations, it is unclear whether significant infrastructure outages result from a malicious nation- state at tack, teen age hacker, insider mistake, or some other source. Irrespective of the source of the outage, each of the policy choices is valid. The challenge, as argued,

("PDD-39 directs the undersigned departments and agencies to perform specific responsibilities that may affect the performance of their responsibilities under the FRP.") Similarly, PDD-63 requires the National Infrastructure Protection Center to "monitor" reconstitution activities. Where owner/operators are unable to stop an attack in order to restore service, assistance from law enforcement and intelligence operations would be extremely valuable.

is integrating them into a cohesive framework that reflects the nation's best interests. National Defense How would a national defense philosophy align with critical infrastructure goals? Since 1995, multiple commentators have encouraged a national defense approach to resolving critical infrastructure protection. These opinions include:
· Require the Defense Department institutionally to manage and coordinate a national critical infrastructure program; · Require the Defense Department to undertake executive agency responsibility for a coordinated incident response and restoration center; or · Wrap critical infrastructure protection policies under the rubric of Homeland Defense or Homeland Security.

the national defense level that the DPA demands. Summary ­ Philosophic Link to DPA At the core of critical infrastructure protection philosophy is a concern for national security, national defense, and the public health and welfare. Critical infrastructure defines a set of policy priorities, i.e., managing competing policy concerns and, where necessary, prioritizing infrastructure service delivery over other equally plausible policy choices. The Defense Production Act is the principal legislative tool for managing critical infrastructure operational needs. Were the nation to require critical infrastructure service delivery, then the full and robust use of the DPA would be essential. Critical infrastructure preparedness, response, and restoration could all benefit from using the DPA in a judicious and targeted manner.

At a minimum, the Defense Department is a customer of critical infrastructure services and must be able to negotiate a level of performance consistent with its goals. Similar to the other issues above, identifying a critical infrastructure framework will lead to appropriate analysis of how the Defense establishment will align with other stakeholders and constituencies. Consumer Protection The final philosophic and legislative option for managing critical infrastructure is consumer protection. A consumer protection methodology provides, at a minimum, assistance and infor ma tion to sup port con sumer goals and options. Consumer protection was a critical component of the significant work performed by the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. One of the valuable lessons from Y2K is the importance of managing consumer confidence, providing information to assist consumer de ci sion mak ing, and sup port ing awareness as a part of any national effort. However, consumer protection issues do not rise to

The Origin and Misperceptions of the DPA
The debate over application of the DPA for critical infrastructure is ultimately a valid disagreement on how the nation should prepare for, respond to, and recover from critical infrastructure incidents of national significance. The DPA must be one of the tools available to the Administration to manage complex critical infrastructure disruptions. That said, there is lim ited agree ment on whether and to what extent the DPA could be used for those purposes. Some of these disagreements are factual, such as whether critical infrastructure incidents truly rise to the level of national import and significance. Other disagreements are more philosophic, such as whether the nation needs an alternative "preparedness and response" framework to man age criti cal in fra struc ture pro tec tion.

The most important legal trigger for use of the DPA is the meaning of the term "national defense."

The second misperception is that the DPA is limited only to preparedness activities. The DPA provides the President with broad authority to expedite delivery of goods and services. Priority contracting and allocation powers, for example, may be used in response and restoration as well as preparedness activities. In many ways, the DPA provides a type of insurance program, which can be used when needed. For response and restoration of critical infrastructure, the use of the DPA is essential.

Presi dent de clares a naposition that the amendment only grants Presi dential authority to engage in certain activities that the Director of FEMA is authorized to engage in, as enumerated in Title VI of the Stafford Act. Others, looking to Title VI in its entirety, adopt a more expansive view, arguing that "emergency prepar ed ness" is defined broadly in Title VI, and that it includes, but is by no means limited to, those activities specified in Title VI. The first significant misperception is that the President may activate the DPA solely for war or mobilizing to go to war. As the discussion on national defense demonstrates, the President must, at a minimum, make a national defense determination. However, Congress has never limited the application to wartime necessity. In fact, many of the Senators during the initial debates in 1950 queried the Truman Administration on this point. The importance of developing an integrated approach to economic security, defense production, and national defense convinced the Senate that such restrictions were not in the best interests of the nation. To date, the DPA makes available materials, services, and facilities in both peacetime and during crisis. For critical infrastructure purposes, this is an especially important aspect of the DPA. In most cases, critical infrastructure outages will not result from war or an act of war, although this is certainly possible. Rather, the DPA provides a far more practical framework for managing infrastructure outages far short of all-out war. tional emergency; this, too, is false. For many Senators involved in the original debates, this was the most troubling component of the Truman legislative proposal. Why should Congress delegate to the President broad peacetime and wartime authority based only on a national defense determination? However, ever since the 1950 debates, Congress has not required a national emergency determination as a trigger for use of the DPA. For critical infrastructure purposes, the ability to activate the DPA absent a formal national emergency finding is practical and useful. Many critical infrastructure outages could lead to national emergencies, and this is part of the attraction for using the DPA. Having to first declare a national emergency would impinge on use of this significant authority.

There is no framework in place that integrates multiple policies, such as traditional emergency preparedness, law enforcement, national defense, and risk management programs that prioritize restoration of infrastructure services.

national significance. A failure to apply the DPA to critical infrastructures leaves this nation unprotected from a cyber attack or significant critical infrastructure disruption. Critical infrastructure supports the national defense in multiple ways. Absent use of the DPA, Congress should begin work immediately on developing alternative legislative frameworks for managing national critical infrastructure disruptions.
