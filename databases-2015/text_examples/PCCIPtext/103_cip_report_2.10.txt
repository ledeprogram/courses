APRIL 2004 / VOLUME 2, NUMBER 10 No other industry has been more scrutinized than aviation since September 11, 2001. Since the advent of flight over one hundred years ago, safety has always been an issue. Security became a serious issue in the early 1970s with a rash of hijackings. Over the last thirty years, the industry implemented progressively sophisticated security techniques including passenger metal detectors, baggage x-rays, tighter airport and aircraft security, and beginning in the 1990s following the first World Trade Center bombing, passenger screening.

THE CIP REPORT
Since the Fall of 2001, great strides have been made in aviation security. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the broader Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have spearheaded this effort. The goal that they have set before themselves is a civil aviation security system that provides both world-class security and world-class customer service. TSA is putting into place a system that is dramatically different than any that we have known in the past. Historically, efficiency was valued above all, but since 9/11, that philosophy is no longer tenable. Central to the new strategy at TSA is the concept of "rings of security," in which many layers, or rings of security, are in place at the same time. They overlap in many areas, and each of them directly contributes to overall security, but in the end none of the rings are relied on exclusively. TSA has invested enormous effort into researching the threats, vulnerabilities, and trends of the current security environment. Indeed, this is the first of the rings of security: domain awareness. The knowledge TSA has gained from this research and analysis has given TSA the confidence to set the agenda in aviation security, from allocating precious resources on one hand to taking preemptive action when necessary on the other. Since 9/11, TSA, along with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has been extremely busy. At local airports around the country, perimeter security has been vastly upgraded, with improvements coming in improved perimeter access roads, access control, electronic surveillance, intrusion detection, and security fencing. The system of personnel

hiring and training has been completely overhauled. More than one million air carrier and airport employees have undergone background checks. Screeners are now proficient in the use of advanced metal detectors and Xray technology. Since February 2002, TSA has intercepted more than 1,600 firearms and over 58,000 box cutters. All the while, they have maintained a high degree of professionalism and diligence in all of their work. It requires a monumental effort to ensure, every time you board a plane, that no one has been able to gain access to the aircraft carrying illegal items. Every piece of checked luggage is tested for explosives, and throughout the airport terminal, TSA-certified canine teams perform numerous missions every single day. Dogs aid with the screening of checked bags and unattended baggage, and they help to search vehicles that approach terminals during increased threat levels. They also play a lead role in responding to bomb threats. The number of Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) has risen from a bare handful to the thousands. They are currently deployed both on high-risk domestic and international flights. And with the transfer of the FAM Service from TSA to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), DHS has the flexibility to augment this force by deploying ICE agents as a (Continued, Page 3)

Aviation Security (Cont. from Page 2) surge force that will increase the number of federal agents on high-risk flights during periods of higher threat. Commercial aircraft operating within the United States are now equipped with hardened cockpit doors. Furthermore, the Federal Flight Deck Officer program has the authority to train, equip, and deputize pilots who volunteer to defend the flight decks of passenger aircraft as the last line of defense. At the current application rate, TSA soon expects to have trained the vast majority volunteers who have met the initial background requirements. Before 9/11, intelligence sharing in and around the Beltway was not where it should have been. These days, the pooling of intelligence resources is one of the most critical aspects in national defense strategy. TSA currently benefits from the resources of many agencies, both within the intelligence community and within law enforcement circles. Within DHS, TSA has the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate (IAIP), which has the responsibility for receiving and analyzing information that relate to threats to the homeland of all types. TSA's Office of Intelligence makes requests to various agencies based upon perceived threats, and then receives information in both raw and finished formats. In many cases, TSA now has the electronic connectivity it needs to many intelligence community databases, in order to remain aware of the threats that other agencies are focusing on. Even with all this connectivity, it has proved invaluable for TSA to have representatives actually posted on-site at other sites within the intelligence and law enforcement communities. This helps to ensure that all threats to transportation security can be passed to TSA as quickly and efficiently as possible. For example, TSA has two liaison officers assigned to the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) adjudicating nominations for TSA watch lists. Beyond that, TSA also supplies detail personnel to assist operations at the TSC call center. When TSA receives information from the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies, whether or not it specifically relates to transportation, it is always reviewed for potential impact on any U.S. transportation assets. The specific threat actors, their capabilities, their motivation, previous operations, and possible locations are all examined in detail. Next, TSA coordinates with all DHS Directorates to review security measures that are already in place, as well as the status of targeted transportation assets. A determination is then made regarding the viability of a threat and the chances that a terrorist operation might be successful. The traditional formulas regarding the original source of the information are also applied when assessing the risk. How credible is the source, and how reliable the new information? --3--

FOIA EXEMPTION FOR AVIATION SECURITY
Shortly after 9/11, President Bush signed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (PL: 10771) into law and expanded Freedom of Information Act exemptions to all transportation issues. Prior to the bill's passage, only aviation-related information could be protected from disclosure to the general public. Lawmakers were concerned after the attacks that vulnerability data about the country's transportation systems could be exploited by terrorists. Congress assigned the Transportation Security Administration the task of drafting regulations to implement the law's FOIA provisions. TSA classified many new categories of information as "sensitive security information" that could be protected from disclosure, including the following: Selection criteria used in any security screening process, including criteria for persons, baggage, or cargo; Securities contingency plans; Any information that TSA determines may reveal a systemic vulnerability in the aviation system; Information concerning threats against transportation; and Information in a vulnerability assessment that has been authorized, approved, or funded by the Department of Transportation. Only after all of this is done is TSA able to complete a comprehensive threat and vulnerability assessment. One of the most visible ways in which TSA (Continued, Page 4)

THE CIP REPORT
Aviation Security (Cont. from Page 3) amplifies potential threats to the transportation industry is via dissemination of watch lists, which enumerate the individuals known or believed to be a threat to civil aviation. TSA also writes several daily products, at both the classified and unclassified levels. Each of them provides information that is of security interest to DHS and to other agencies both inside the Beltway and around the nation. In the event that the level of threat is high enough to justify an official warning to industry, TSA has numerous options at its disposal. The top decision makers in government can be alerted immediately, so that they are able to quickly leverage any other national-level resources that need to be brought to bear. TSA operates a 24/7 Transportation Security Coordination Center (TSCC) that coordinates all security-related operations vis-à-vis all modes of transportation. If the incident calls for detailed warnings to be written, TSA puts out products entitled Information Circulars, which may provide specific guidance on what security measures for industry stakeholders should implement. Throughout the United States, one of the most important roles has become that of the Federal Security Director (FSD), of which there are now 158. The FSD is responsible for coordinating all TSA security activities at airports, to include the planning, execution, and management of operations. All of the FSDs arrive at TSA from distinguished careers. Their ranks include Flag Officers from the military, special agents from the FBI, Secret Service, and Drug Enforcement Administration as well as top industry executives. In order to properly secure the --4--

APRIL 2004 / VOLUME 2, NUMBER 10 transportation sector from terrorist attack, it is vital that the private sector play a robust role in all aspects of the effort. This partnership between the government and industry cannot be overstated. In fact, industry stakeholders must now be held accountable for their own, delineated contributions to transportation security. This includes air carriers, airports, and transportation operators. This is an evolving relationship, and currently TSA has a progressive enforcement policy that stresses immediate corrective action ahead of the imposition of civil penalties. In terms of security technology, TSA's goal is to stay at least one step ahead of those wanting to do harm. TSA has invested enormous effort into building research and development that is robust, which works closely with the DHS Science and Technology Directorate to develop and deploy security technologies that will make the nation's transportation security more effective, more efficient, and less expensive to maintain. TSA is currently testing explosives trace detection portals that passively analyze the air for explosive material as passengers walk through them. Its scientists are also developing a document scanner that can detect traces of explosives on any documents that a passenger may have been holding. TSA is continuously evaluating its own security procedures and vulnerabilities. It employs robust, covert "red teaming" that challenges its employees to detect many (Continued, Page 15)

John Luke III, C.M. Airport Manager Montgomery County Revenue Authority "Providing security at a busy general aviation airport closer than 20 miles from the White House naturally poses a challenge. In the absence of a federal mandated security program, you rely not only on your physical surroundings (security fence, code controlled access gates, deterrent signage, etc.,) but also on your locally based pilot population to be the eyes and ears of your informal security force. These people know and can tell who should be on the airfield at a given time and are not bashful to challenge anyone who looks or acts suspicious."

Pat Hynes began his federal law enforcement career in 1970 with the FBI, and later joined the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as a special agent where he rose to the position of deputy director. He now works for the Transportation Security Administration serving as the Federal Security Director (FSD) for Reagan National Airport. The position of FSD was created by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act signed by President Bush on November 19, 2001. FSDs are directly responsible for a full range of airport security enforcement and oversight at all of the nation's airports, with duties including: The efficient implementation, performance and enhancement of security and screening standards for TSA employees; Airport security risk assessments; Supervision of federal law enforcement activity within the purview of the TSA; and Organizing and implementing the Federal Security Crisis Management Response Plan for each airport.

'Every Day is Opening Night' for Reagan National Airport Security

Patrick D. Hynes Federal Security Director Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport

When asked how he manages so many critical responsibilities, Mr.Hynes explained his metaphor of a three-legged stool. One leg is the Airport Manager and Chief of Police, who represent the Airport Authority; one leg is the air carriers; and TSA is the third leg. "Nothing is done at this airport without the collaboration of all three. This is a partnership." In fact, Mr. Hynes begins each day in a meeting with Chris Browne, the Airport Manager, who he credits with playing an integral role in TSA's mission and success at Reagan National. One of the biggest challenges for Federal Security Directors is integrating world-class security with world-class customer service. "We are making a commitment to the flying public that when they step onto an airplane it is safe, because we have screened every person, every piece of baggage and all of the cargo that is on board. But we also want to provide top of the line customer service, which isn't always easy with so many security constraints." Mr. Hynes' tool belt for tackling this job includes professionally trained screeners, state of the art explosives detection and trace equipment, a canine force trained in explosives detection, and a covert training group. Each morning he receives a readiness report which enables him to ensure that the airport's security mission has 100% of the required resources. Hynes is also in constant communication with the intelligence community and the FBI, particularly because of the high-profile nature of the airport. "This is the Nation's Airport. With so many heads of state, politicians, top industry representatives, other VIP's, and millions of tourists passing through our gates, we must always be at our best. My motto is 'Every day is opening night.' We must never forget why the Department of Homeland Security was formed, and our work must never become mundane or routine. We have to get it right every single time."

CAPPS II and the Fourth Amendment: Does It Fly?
by Guest Columnist Deborah v. Rochow-Leuschner
ly to be searched as young Arabic men. If something in the traveler's background triggers a yellow score, that person may be questioned, and both carry on and checked baggage will be searched. Law enforcement will be called in to question travelers with a red or "no fly" indicator. It is unclear which 5th amendment protections will apply in this case. The program is controversial because of the myriad individual factors that are analyzed in determining a person's threat level. Further, most elements of the profile are classified to prevent terrorists from undermining the system. At a minimum, the CAPPS II background check will include an FBI check, credit check, analysis of financial and transactional records, and travel patterns. The complex algorithms will look for evidence that a traveler is "rooted in the community." Although the TSA believes that this program will be highly effective in preventing potential terrorists from ever boarding an aircraft, the program's critics believe CAPPS II is an abject invasion of privacy. Trying to predict a person's behavior is like searching for "thought crimes." Never before has so much information from so many sources been collected in a single place. The "digital dossiers" may fall into the --6-- wrong hands. "Function creep" is inevitable as the IRS, law enforcement, and various other agencies seek access to the data. Furthermore, people may be arrested at the airport or denied the right to travel because of infractions that have nothing to do with security of the flight. Racial, ethnic, and even gender discrimination will rear its ugly head as people are scrutinized based on immutable characteristics. Further, the error rate may be unacceptable. If just one percent of the population scores a false positive, more than 6 million unjustified inquiries are performed per year. The Fourth Amendment protects Americans' privacy from invasive "search and seizures" whether physical or virtual. The landmark case Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967) pronounced that privacy protects people not places, and if a person has an actual and reasonable expectation of privacy, the government may not violate this interest without probable cause and a warrant. Most travelers are unaware of the background checks being surreptitiously performed, and would reasonably expect that their personal information is private. So how will CAPPS II comply with the Fourth Amendment? The paper (Continued, Page 15)

The worst international terrorist attack ever-involving four separate but coordinated aircraft hijackings-rocked the United States on September 11, 2001 killing more than 3,000 random victims. Although hijackings have plagued the airline industry since its inception, this new breed of mass-murder suicide hijackers has brought the airlines to the brink of ruin. As a result of inadequacies in airline security, the government stepped in and federalized the entire airport screening industry. The crown jewel of the new Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is a powerful networked database system that runs a background check on every single passenger in the time it takes to get a boarding card. The purpose of the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II (CAPPS II) is to analyze various factors in each traveler's background, and then to predict whether a person poses a potential threat to the flight. Travelers will receive a red, yellow or green score. The majority of travelers will get a green light, and will pass through standard security procedures, making the process more efficient for all. In the random system previously used, grandmothers were as like-

Sharing Information to Make the Skies Safer
groups (pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers, and flight attendants), civil aviation authorities, accident investigation boards, air traffic service providers, aviation trade associations, military aviation, and university groups involved in aviation safety. "Most of the information sharing taking place is through informal networks, but we are in the process of making GAIN a systematic worldwide program," explains Christopher Hart, Assistant Administrator for System Safety at the Federal Aviation Administration. Two main areas of focus include legal, regulatory, and cultural issues that may deter information sharing, as well as development of analytical tools that can handle massive amounts of safety-related information. Significant strides have been made in both of these areas. According to Hart, one of the biggest challenges is bringing all of the various players together to create a system approach. "We can no longer look at components such as manufacturing or air traffic control in a vacuum. The safety issues of tomorrow are system issues that involve every link in the chain." Four GAIN Working Groups accomplish the work of GAIN by studying issues, conducting or facilitating surveys and other research, compiling knowledge from group members and peers in other safety organizations, and documenting (Continued, Page 13)

The Global Aviation Information Network is an industry-led international coalition of airlines, manufacturers, employee groups, governments and other aviation organizations formed to promote and facilitate the voluntary collection and sharing of safety information by and among users in the international aviation community to improve aviation safety. The GAIN concept was proposed in May 1996 as a way to significantly improve aviation safety through the enhanced use of safety information. One of the prerequisites to the collection and sharing of safety information is the culture of the organization itself. Thus, GAIN is promoting the "just culture" concept, which describes an atmosphere of trust in which people are encouraged, even rewarded, for providing essential safety-related information - but in which they are also clear about where the line must be drawn between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. The policy of just culture is designed to encourage compliance with the appropriate regulations and procedures, foster safe operating practices, and promote the development of internal evaluation programs. Over 1,000 aviation safety professionals from 54 countries have participated in the GAIN program since its inception in 1996. Organizations participating in GAIN include airlines, airframe manufacturers, avionics and safety software developers, employee

AIRLINES 101
A refresher on the aviation industry, excerpted from The Airline Handbook by the Air Transport Association The Airline Deregulation Act Today's airline industry is radically different from what it was prior to 1978. At that time, the industry resembled a public utility, with a government agency, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), determining the routes each airline flew and overseeing the prices they charged. Today, it is a market-driven industry, with customer demand determining the levels of service and price. The turning point was the Airline Deregulation Act, approved by Congress on October 24, 1978 and signed into law four days later by President Jimmy Carter. Pressure for airline deregulation had been building for many years, particularly among economists who pointed out, in numerous studies, that unregulated intrastate airfares were substantially lower than fares for interstate flights of comparable distances. What Remains Regulated Among the CAB functions shifted to other parts of the government were the responsibility for awarding landing rights and other privileges in foreign countries to U.S. carriers. International air services are usually governed by air-transport service agreements, referred to as bilaterals, between two nations. These agreements specify such things as the cities each nations' airlines may serve, the number of flights they may operate, and how much regulatory authority the governments will exercise over fares. Bilateral negotiations involving the United States are led by the State Department, with active DOT policy input and participation. Effects of Deregulation A major development that followed deregulation was the widespread development of hub-andspoke networks, which existed on a more limited basis prior to 1978. Hubs are strategically located airports used as transfer points for passengers and cargo traveling from one community to another. They are also collection points for passengers and cargo traveling to and from the immediate region to other parts of the country or points overseas. Airlines schedule banks of flights into and out of their hubs several times a day. Each bank includes dozens of planes arriving within minutes of each other. Once on the ground, the arriving passengers and cargo from those flights are transferred conveniently to other planes, that will take them to their final destinations. Types of Airline Certification U.S. scheduled airlines are classified by the government on the basis of the amount of revenue generated from operations. --10-- These classifications are major, national and regional. All airlines hold two certificates from the federal government: a fitness certificate and an operating certificate. The Department of Transportation (DOT) issues fitness certificates - called certificates of public convenience and necessity - under it's statutory authority. Basically, the certificate establishes that the carrier has the financing and the management in place to provide scheduled service. The certificate typically authorizes both passenger and cargo service. Operating certificates, on the other hand, are issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), which spell out numerous requirements for operating aircraft with 10 or more seats. The requirements cover such things as the training of flight crews and aircraft maintenance programs. All majors, nationals and regionals operate with a Part 121 certificate. Major airlines generate operating revenues of more than $1 billion annually. Previously called trunk carriers, they generally provide nationwide, and in some cases, worldwide service. There were 12 major U.S. passenger airlines in 2000: Alaska, America West, American, American Eagle, American Trans Air, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Southwest, (Continued, Page 11)

THE CIP REPORT
Airlines 101 (Cont. from Page 10) Trans World, United and US Airways. In addition, three allcargo airlines were classified as majors: DHL Airways, FedEx and United Parcel Service. Chief Characteristics of the Airline Business Because of all of the equipment and facilities involved in air transportation, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that this is, fundamentally, a service industry. Airlines perform a service for their customers - transporting them and their belongings (or their products, in the case of cargo customers) from one point to another for an agreed price. In that sense, the airline business is similar to other service businesses like banks, insurance companies or even barbershops. There is no physical product given in return for the money paid by the customer, nor inventory created and stored for sale at some later date. Unlike many service businesses, airlines need more than storefronts and telephones to get started. They need an enormous range of expensive equipment and facilities, from airplanes to flight simulators to maintenance hangars. As a result, the airline industry is a capital-intensive business, requiring large sums of money to operate effectively. Most equipment is financed through loans or the issuance of stock. Increasingly, airlines are also leasing equipment, including equipment they owned previously but sold to someone else and leased back. Whatever arrangements an airline chooses to pursue, its capital needs require consistent profitability. Because airlines own large fleets of expensive aircraft which depreciate in value over time, they typically generate a substantial positive cash flow (profits plus depreciation). Most airlines use their cash flow to repay debt or acquire new aircraft. When profits and cash flow decline, an airline's ability to repay debt and acquire new aircraft is jeopardized. Airlines also are labor intensive. Each major airline employs a virtual army of pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, baggage handlers, reservation agents, gate agents, security personnel, cooks, cleaners, managers, accountants, lawyers, etc. Computers have enabled airlines to automate many tasks, but there is no changing the fact that they are a service business, where customers require personal attention. More than one-third of the revenue generated each day by the airlines goes to pay its workforce. Labor costs per employee are among the highest of any industry. In part because of its long history as a regulated industry, the airline industry is highly unionized. The bottom line result of all of this is thin profit margins, even in the best of times. Airlines, through the years, have earned a net profit between one and two percent, compared to an average of above five percent for U.S. --11--

APRIL 2004 / VOLUME 2, NUMBER 10 industry as a whole. The airline business historically has been very seasonal. The summer months were extremely busy, as many people took vacations at that time of the year. Winter, on the other hand, was slower, with the exception of the holidays. The result of such peaks and valleys in travel patterns was that airline revenues also rose and fell significantly through the course of the year. This pattern continues today, although it is less pronounced than in the past. The growth in the demand for air transportation since deregulation has substantially lessened the valleys. Airline Revenue - Where the Money Comes From About 75 percent of the U.S. airline industry's revenue comes from passengers; about 15 percent from cargo shippers, the largest of which is the U.S. Postal Service. The remaining 10 percent comes from other transportrelated services. For the all-cargo carriers, of course, cargo is the sole source of transportation revenue. For the major passenger airlines which also carry cargo in the bellies of their planes, less than 10 percent of revenue comes from cargo (in many cases far less). Airline Costs - Where the Money Goes According to reports filed with the Department of Transportation in 1999, airline costs were as follows: (Continued, Page 12)

THE CIP REPORT
Airlines 101 (Cont. from Page 11) Flying Operations - essentially any cost associated with the operation of aircraft, such as fuel and pilot salaries - 27%; Maintenance - both parts and labor - 13%; Aircraft and Traffic Service basically the cost of handling passengers, cargo and aircraft on the ground and including such things as the salaries of baggage handlers, dispatchers and airline gate agents - 16%; Promotion/Sales - including advertising, reservations and travel agent commissions 13 %; Passenger Service - mostly inflight service and including such things as food and flight attendant salaries - 9%; Transport Related - delivery trucks and inflight sales - 10 %; Administrative - 6%; Depreciation/Amortization equipment and plants - 6%. Labor costs are common to nearly all of those categories. When looked at as a whole, labor accounts for 35 percent of the airlines' operating expenses and 75 percent of controllable costs. Fuel is the airlines' second largest cost (about 10 to 12 percent of total expenses), and travelagent commissions is third (about 6 percent). Commission costs, as a percent of total costs, have recently been declining, as more sales are now made directly to the customer through electronic commerce. Another rapidly rising cost has been airport landing fees and terminal rents.

APRIL 2004 / VOLUME 2, NUMBER 10 Founded by a group of 14 airlines meeting in Chicago in 1936, the Air Transport Association was the first, and today remains, the only trade organization for the principal U.S. airlines. In that capacity it has played a major role in all the major government decisions regarding aviation since its founding, including the creation of the Civil Aeronautics Board, the creation of the air traffic control system, and airline deregulation. The purpose of the ATA is to support and assist its members by promoting the air transport industry and the safety, cost effectiveness, and technological advancement of its operations; advocating common industry positions before state and local governments; conducting designated industry-wide programs; and assuring governmental and public understanding of all aspects of air transport.

George Mason University (GMU), in cooperation with universities in Virginia, Maryland, and Washington DC, is leading a new homeland security initiative. The program, termed the Critical Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment (CIVA) Project, aims to enhance safety and security in the 12 jurisdictions that comprise the National Capitol Region (NCR) by improving government and industry methods of identifying infrastructure vulnerabilities. The NCR-CIVA Project is part of a broader Federal effort to protect the nation's urban areas. In 2002, Congress worked with the Administration to create the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), which provides funding for local safety officials and first responders to secure infrastructure and prepare for acts of terrorism. George Mason University, under a grant from UASI, founded the NCR-CIVA and partnered with James Madison University, the University of Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, the University of Maryland, and Howard University. GAIN (Cont. from Page 9) this information in GAIN reports. Groups meet several times each year, in person and by teleconference. Participation on Working Groups is open to all interested parties. Many other industries, including other transportation modes, health care, national security, chemical manufacturing, nuclear The Project began work in late 2003 and was officially launched in March of 2004. In the beginning, the Project analyzed the effects of Hurricane Isabel on regional infrastructures and produced a detailed assessment of the interdependencies revealed by the storm. With the valuable experience gained from this effort, NCR-CIVA member universities began a series of activities focused on the DC area to improve the vulnerability assessment process. Currently, George Mason University is collecting and reviewing existing vulnerability assessment procedures, processes, and tools employed in the following infrastructure sectors: banking and finance, emergency services, energy, health services, postal and shipping, telecommunications, transportation, and water. Going forward, GMU and partner universities plan to collect information about private sector vulnerability assessments through discussions with infrastructure owners and operators. After gathering and evaluating power, public utilities, and information infrastructure protection are similarly trying to develop programs to use information proactively to improve safety. GAIN is coordinating with them in order to make better use of scarce resources by avoiding duplication of efforts.

components of these vulnerability assessments, NCR-CIVA universities will develop a best practice process for conducting them. This will help ensure processes are coordinated and appropriately integrated so that security activities are effective, consistent, and cost-effective. While these best practice recommendations will support individual sector needs, they will also provide standard elements that allow for cross-sector comparisons for use in local, state, and regional critical infrastructure protection efforts. GMU also plans to provide policy and business practice recommendations for implementation of the NCR-CIVA Project findings. The NCR-CIVA Project's vision is to develop an open standard for conducting vulnerability assessments. This open standard can evolve over time and incorporate new best practices as they are identified. Ultimately, the Project seeks to raise the level of security in the National Capital Region by ensuring that critical infrastructure sectors address the most important security concerns. tributed to the problem, and what factors prevented an incident or accident are applicable to many other sectors in the areas of safety, critical infrastructure protection, and national security," said Hart.

Transportation Infrastructure Security: Innovative Technology for Vehicle, Operator and Cargo Identification
Michael S. Bronzini, Dewberry Chair Professor School of Information Technology and Engineering
The data required to protect critical infrastructure extends to information about vehicular traffic in transportation systems. Traditional traffic sensing and surveillance systems focus on macroscopic stream measures, such as traffic volume, speed and density, and vehicle classification. This CIP research project considers the threats to transportation infrastructure security, and focuses on the potential application of both traditional and innovative vehicle detection technologies for vehicle, operator, and cargo identification. The ultimate goal is to help create an infrastructure system with the ability to identify vehicles, operators, cargos and contents. As a key phase of this project a two-day Faculty Workshop will be organized and held during late July or early August of 2004. The objectives of the workshop are to: Evaluate and critique current and near-term vehicle detection technologies; Evaluate and critique current and near-term vehicle identification system designs; Propose technologies to aid in vehicle detection and identification; Propose vehicle detection and identification systems designs; Propose demonstration of the use of an innovative technology; Decide on a research and demonstration plan. To support the workshop a technology scan working paper is under development.

The bottom line is the inevitable tradeoff between security and terrorist threat or is the subject of an outstanding warrant for violent criminal behavior.

Judges who like the protections offered by CAPPS II will find rationalizations in the Fourth Amendment for upholding it, and those who dislike the surveillance aspects will also find grounds in the Fourth Amendment for banning it. Travelers will also have diverse viewpoints. Plenty of people will welcome the added security, believing they have "nothing to hide." Others will see this as a slippery slope to totalitarianism. Time will tell. (unknown or elevated risk), or red (high risk). CAPPS II is a threat-based system that will be under the direct control of the Federal government. It will be a major improvement over the current CAPPS system, in which all threat-related information is disparate and under the control of airlines themselves. Throughout the testing and implementation of CAPPS II, DHS will be scrupulously mindful of the rights and freedoms that define our Nation and distinguish American society from those of the terrorists who seek to do us harm.
The information for this piece was extracted from Admiral James Loy's testimony to the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, January 27, 2004.

CAPPS II performs this important mission in two phases. It first attempts to verify the identity of each passenger by matching the limited information available, such as name, date of birth, or address, with commercially available databases. Next, CAPPS II performs a risk assessment, which is based upon a list of names that include known or suspected terrorists and those who are subject to an outstanding warrant for violent criminal behavior. Based on the traveler's "risk score", an encoded message will be printed on the boarding pass that will indicate the passenger's appropriate level of risk: green (no risk), yellow

The CIP Project is part of the National Center for Technology and Law at the George Mason University School of Law. It is a joint initiative between GMU and JMU that examines law, technology, and policy to find comprehensive solutions to the most pressing CIP issues for policy makers and critical infrastructure owners and operators. The CIP Project was launched in May 2002. The CIP Project encourages participation by representatives from all levels of government, academia, and private industry.
